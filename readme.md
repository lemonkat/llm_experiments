### LemonKat's LLM experiments

These are a couple experiments using GPT-3 and GPT-4 to emulate conversations between fictional characters.

The example conversation included is between Alice, who believes her house is on fire, and Bob, who disagrees.

#### To run:
1. create a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to your OpenAI API key.
2. run `python3 main.py`

Included in `presets.py` is some sample code to pull example quotes and other information about a character from a video game wiki.
